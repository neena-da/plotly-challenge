This project contains an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.


The dashboard is deployed at https://neena-da.github.io/github-pages/

It has the following information for the individual selected from the dropdown.

Demographic information of the selected individual
Horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual
Bubble chart to show the sample information
Gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual
